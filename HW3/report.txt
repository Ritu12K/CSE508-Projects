Test Environment:
Ubuntu 16.04.5

Compiler Version:
gcc version 5.4.0


Commands to run the program:
Server side:  pbproxy -k mykey -l 2222 localhost 22
Client side:   ssh -o "ProxyCommand ./pbproxy -k mykey localhost 2222" localhost

My implementation includes:
1. All the required functionality as mentioned in the question
2. I/O multiplexing
3. Encryption and description is done using AES in CTR mode from OpenSSL library

In order to compile you have to install openssl. After installing, you could use "make" to compile the code.

Working explained:

1. Main function:

step a. Takes the input command arguments using getopt.
step b. It determines if the proxy is invoked as server or client based on whether option '-l' was received or not.
step c. Based on the result of step b, it calls the appropriate function for the proxy (either server mode or client mode).

2. Client Proxy Mode:
step a. Creates a client socket and binds it.
step b. Connects to the Server.
step c. I/O multiplexing is ensured by setting stdin and socket connection to non-blocking mode to avoid blocking forever using fcntl flag setting.
step d. I create a random sequence of 8 bits for IV and send it to the server prior to sending any messages
step e. If I receive something from stdin, I am encrypting it using key and iv first and then sending it to the proxy server.
        If I received something from socket, simply write the original data to stdout.

2. Server Proxy Mode:
step a. Creates a server socket and binds it.
step b. Accepts connection from clients.
step c. Establishes ssh connection to the client.
step d. I/O multiplexing is ensured by setting socket connection and ssh connection to non-blocking mode to avoid blocking forever using fcntl flag setting.
step e. If I receive something from socket connection, I am decrypting it using key and then sending it to the ssh server.
        If I receive anything from the ssh server, I am encrypting it and sending back to client.
